# What?

A simple python program which makes a folder called '100DaysOfCode' with 100
folders inside it, a README file and a .gitignore file.

- Each folder contains a README file to help document what you have learnt that
  day or just to write TODOs.

- The .gitignore file has all the names of the folder so that you can add one
  folder at a time.

- The README file at the root project contains general info about the 100DaysOfCode
  challenge.

## How to get started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run main.py
3. Give it the path you want to have the folder you want.
4. Done

> See example folder - 100DaysOfCode include in the repo
